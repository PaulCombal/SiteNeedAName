# Site name goes here

<logo here>

<Site name> is the first site to reference IPFS files and provide an easy way to access them to every user on the net. It provides handy tools both for users and moderators to manage their content.


Even though the whole development of this site is done in english, the interface of the site will entirely be in french. Just be aware of that. If you want to implement a translation system, go ahead, but this is absolutely not required feature for this project.
